# MyDnD

## Did you ever thought "that so much time wasted arraging my character sheet ?"
Whatever it was DnD or another RP game that shouldn't be the case.
We think that you should spend time opn things that matter and not checking if any rule event the most obscure are followed.

## The Goal
That's why we are developing MyDnD, this tool does all the heavy lifting duiring your character sheet creation/update.
Once all the rule of your preferred RPG are loaded into the system ( it will be very easy thanks to the lua language ),
they will be respected and activated only when necessary.
